### Project: Follow Me

### Write Up
In this project created a Deep Neural Network - a Fully Convolution Dee[Neural Network to train the images from the simulator to identify a specific target herein after is referred to as "hero". Classified the hero from others using two different colors of pixels one for hero and other for all others using the sematic segmentation.

Steps followed :
1) Set up the environment 
2) Get Data
3) Code
4) Train the Neural Network to acheive the more than .40 accuracy.
5) Test the trained data in the Simulator.
